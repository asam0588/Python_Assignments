    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "A: Python is not domain specific and can be used for web-development, application development, scientific research etc.so it is \n",
    "    general purpose.\n",
    "    High-level : Because it has a user friendly programming context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "A:  Because we need not declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?\n",
    "A: Pros:\n",
    "        -Python is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to write.\n",
    "        -It integrates with other programming languages like C, C++, and Java.\n",
    "        -Python supports extensive libraries for differnt features.\n",
    "        -Python is platform-independent means you can write code once and \n",
    "            run it anywhere.\n",
    "    Cons:\n",
    "        -Python is not suitable for developing mobile applications and games.\n",
    "        -Python works with the interpreter. That's why it is slower than other \n",
    "            programming languages like C and C++\n",
    "            \n",
    "Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?\n",
    "A:  \n",
    "    -GUI applications.\n",
    "    -Web applications.\n",
    "    -Scrape data from websites\n",

    "    -Handle Big Data & perform mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?\n",
    "A:  Variables are named locations that are used to store information in \n",
    "    memory. The names we choose for variables and functions are commonly known as Identifiers.\n",
    "    -Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?\n",
    "A:input ()function takes the input from the user\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?\n",
    "A: Sting  <type ‘str’>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. What is type casting?\n",
    "A: Changing the datatype of one variable to another, float to int, int to string etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?\n",
    "A: No, input() function does not allow the user to provide values separated by a new line.\n",
    " Whenever the user presses the enter key, the input function reads information provided by the user and stops execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are keywords?\n",
    "A: Keywords are reserved words in a programming language whijch cannot be used as variable or function names.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.\n",
    "A:  No keywords can't be used as a variable it's because keywords have predefined meanings. \n",
    "    If we try to use a keyword as variable we get an error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?\n",
    "A: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Python indentation is a way of telling a \n",
    "    Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "Q14. What are operators in Python?\n",
    "A: Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?\n",
    "A: / is division (float) and // for floor division.floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.\n",
    "A: print(\"iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.\n",

    "\n",
    "    if (number % 2) == 0:\n",
    "        print('The number you entered is even')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('The number you entered is odd')\n",
